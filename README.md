# WWIDataVis
A quick project to monkey around with some of the features of [D3](http://d3js.org/) and [Dimple](http://dimplejs.org/), based on some exercises during a presentation by [Jonathan Dinu](https://github.com/jay-oh-en) at [Strata + Hadoop 2015](http://strataconf.com/big-data-conference-ca-2015). Data taken from [about.com](http://europeanhistory.about.com/cs/worldwar1/a/blww1casualties.htm), note that some of the numbers don't quite add up.
